# GD Ray

Old student project ray caster.

## Look out - potential mess ahead

This repository is an automatic port of an old Mercurial repo and has been cleaned of personal data automatically.
For this reason some parts could be broken or will at least look ugly.

Untidy commits as well ...

The code requires [EasyBMP](http://easybmp.sourceforge.net/) to be located in `src/ext-libs`, which is not included to keep legal / copyright stuff away.
