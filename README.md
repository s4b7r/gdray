# GD Ray

Old student project ray caster.

## Look out - potential mess ahead

This repository is an automatic port of an old Mercurial repo and has been cleaned of personal data automatically.
For this reason some parts could be broken or will at least look ugly.

Untidy commits as well ...

The code requires [EasyBMP](http://easybmp.sourceforge.net/) to be located in `src/ext-libs`, which is not included to keep legal / copyright stuff away.

## Let's learn something together

I could have decided to just forget about this old project or even to delete this repository (just discarding old stuff and missing out on the opportunity to revisit your old creations is a terrible thing to do, by the way), but for some obsucre reason I've decided to put some work into it, clean up and publish on GitHub. Now that it's set free let's try to learn something together. ...and the fact that you are still reading the readme of some obscure repository of some person located somewhere in the world is telling me you maybe are into learning and discovery.

So feel free to take this code, look into what my former fellow student and me have created and try to spot what has been done good, what could have been done better or what bits are just incomprehensible. Let's try to fix it together and learn from each other. Maybe together we will unterstand what past me has done here?! ;-)

By the way: This does also apply for all my other stuff, especially my other 'legacy' projects / repos. I'm shure there is some interesting stuff (a.k.a. errors to learn from) to find.
